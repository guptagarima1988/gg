# FAIR data entity test

## Purpose of this document

This document tests if you can read data and see a row from that data on your machine.

## Open the data from your local machine

> Make sure the data is copied into local-data/ there is a listing in the .gitignore that ensures anything in this folder ignored when pushing to the github. 

This folder does not push your development data to the internet, and ensures privacy. 

## Install readxl to read excel file into R

```{r}
# Install the readxl package if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("readxl", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("readxl")
}


# Load the readxl library
library(readxl)

```

# Read and display a row of data

```{r}

# Read the .xlsx file
SDGPref_Arunachal_raw <- read_excel("local-data/SDGPreferences_Arunachal.xlsx")

# Display the first rows of the data
head(SDGPref_Arunachal_raw, 1)
```
