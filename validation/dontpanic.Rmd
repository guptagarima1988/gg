# dontpanic test

This is the first piece of code to run: the `dontpanic test`. 

## intention

The purpose of this test is to check your workflow is functional.

## store value

We store a number in a computational object.

```{r}

dontpanic <- 42

```

## return value

And return the data that object stores. 
```{r}

dontpanic

```

If all is working, you will see `[1] 42` printed.

## dontpanictest
```{r}
dontpanic <- 'test'

dontpanic


```
