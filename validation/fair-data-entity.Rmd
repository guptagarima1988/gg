# FAIR data entity test

## Purpose of this document

This document tests if you can read data and see a row from that data on your machine.

## Open the data from your local machine

> Make sure the data is copied into local-data/ there is a listing in the .gitignore that ensures anything in this folder ignored when pushing to the github. 

This folder does not push your development data to the internet, and ensures privacy. 

## Install readxl to read excel file into R

```{r}
#| message: false

# Load the readxl library
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

```

# Set local path

Here we set where the data are located.

```{r}
# set directory your data is in
data_path <- "../local-data"

# set name of file
data_file <- "SDGPreferences_Arunachal.xlsx"


```

# Read and display a row of data

```{r}
# Read the .xlsx file
SDGPref_Arunachal_raw <- read_excel("../data-raw/SDGPreferences_Arunachal.xlsx")

# Dimensions of data
dim(SDGPref_Arunachal_raw)

# Display the first rows of the data
head(SDGPref_Arunachal_raw, 1)
```

# Test an assumption about the data

> Nerds, I'm going to write a function that finds the set of minimal unique combination of columns that define a row in a table in R unless we find a tool that does that for me. 

We assume the rows of `SDGPref_Arunachal_raw` are uniquely identified by `Respondents`.

```{r}
n_unique_key <- SDGPref_Arunachal_raw |>
  # here is where we set the assumption about the unique combination of columns
  select(Respondents) |>
  # this line removes duplicates (which shouldn't exist)
  distinct() |>
  # count how many
  nrow()

# print result
n_unique_key
```

We compare with the number of rows in `SDGPref_Arunachal_raw`.

```{r}
n_unique_key == nrow(SDGPref_Arunachal_raw)
```
