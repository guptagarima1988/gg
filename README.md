# Charles & Garima

Hi Garima,

I only know how to do "the code bit". You have really important scientific things to say.  

Consider the Good Enough Data & Systems Lab as your coding accompanist; like a piano accompanist is hired to play at a performance where the soloist chooses the music, the venue, etc. 

How can we help you do good enough science? 

# The code bit

This online space is where I can share the code bits you need with you.

# Why be good at everything? 

I cannot ever catch up to your knowledge about sustainable development. 

I can't think of anything cooler than helping someone (you) who can see the mismatch in priorities
between government, people, and ecology say what needs saying in the global south.

You decide what needs saying. The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab will help you with the code bits
that will help you say the important things that so often only someone like you understands.

# Cross-disciplinary collaboration 

A frustration the Good Enough Lab has is with poorly applied computation. Instead of feeling like
you should learn to code better, let's figure out the smoothest way for the Good Enough Lab to help
you. Why do scientists like you feel like they also have to code? Wouldn't it be better to find Good Enough 
ways for coders like me to collaborate with scientists like you?

## Starting suggestion

Issues are a way for us to make notes on a specific work item.

- Garima opens an [issue](https://github.com/softloud/gg/issues) for each coding thing she is slowed down by
- Charles will comment on the issue with progress or clarifications

## Side benefits

- Finding out a Good Enough way to collaborate across disciplines is potentially publishable in scientific epistemology
- The Good Enough Lab is writing applied mathematics papers on scientific systems epistemology and will use these projects as examples, so you become second author on those
- The Good Enough Lab will publish in the open in any case
- Blog provides a place where we can communicate the shitfuckery of systems; the stupid decisions made by leadership that cause real-world harm
